Overview
--------

Thanks for your interest in the Math Team. We've put together a quick
and (we hope) fun programming problem to test your abilities on real
weather data. We expect you to take several hours to complete this
problem. Please write your program in Python (strongly preferred),
Java, Clojure, R or Octave. If you use Java, please provide a build
file for Apache Ant. If you use any non-standard libraries, please
package them with your submission or point to public repositories so
that we can install them.


Data
----

The file training.csv contains 10958 lines and 501 comma-separated
columns. Each line contains a date followed by temperatures recorded on
that day at 500 unique locations across a large geographical area.
Thus, the leftmost column contains a sequence of dates, and each of the
remaining 500 columns contains a corresponding daily time series of
temperatures for a given location. Dates are represented in POSIX
strftime format "%Y-%m-%d" and range from January 1, 1980
("1980-01-01") to December 31, 2009 ("2009-12-31"). Temperature values
are reported in degrees Celsius and are rounded to the nearest integer.


Task
----

Please write a program that learns from the data in training.csv to
predict temperatures at later dates. The program must take training.csv
from STDIN and output predicted temperatures for every day from January
1, 2010 to December 31, 2010. The output must be written to STDOUT in
the same comma-separated line format as training.csv.


Evaluation
----------

We will evaluate your predictions against the observed temperatures in
the year 2010. The performance metric will be mean squared prediction
error. We want to know what statistical assumptions you made. Please
explain your assumptions in comments or documentation. We also care
about style. Elegant, concise, modular code will win over ugly, brittle
code, even if the latter achieves a smaller prediction error.

Happy hacking! We look forward to reading and running your code.
